ident.pl        - the ident server script
test.pl         - a test script
identserver.ini - config file for the server, should be in the same directory
                  as ident.pl

./ident.pl -h|--help for usage

Notes:

ident.pl requires Net::IdentServer which can be installed from cpan

test.pl requires IO::Socket/IO::Socket::INET which is part of Perl core

ident.pl is configured to run on the default Ident (RFC 1413) port of 113,
which requires root permissions so the port can be opened and bound to.  If
you want to remove this requirement, edit identserver.ini and change the port
to something > 1024 then modify the test script to attach to that port (or
telnet to that port).

You will also want to change user and possibly group in identserver.ini.
